is_self_synchronizing_code
==========================

An encoding -- after experiencing an error or when being dropped into the middle -- can seek out the start of the next sequence of well-formed input unambiguously, compared with other encodings that reuse bit patterns from the first matching code unit / byte in subsequent code units / bytes in that pattern. This becomes a property of the encoding, and is therefore called *self synchronizing*. Self synchronizing codes are frequently considered superior when there is a lack of context.

The primary :doc:`Unicode encodings </known unicode encodings>` are self synchronizing, but other versions both proprietary and not may fail to be self-synchronizing such as UTF-7.
