skip_input_error
================

Utilizes :doc:`ztd::text::is_input_error_skippable </api/is_input_error_skippable>` to check if a hypothetical encoding object ``encoding`` and a hypothetical result object ``result`` can be utilized to call `encoding.skip_input_error(result)`. Otherwise, it only skips forward by

It is particularly used with :doc:`ztd::text::replacement_handler </api/error handlers/replacement_handler>` and :doc:`ztd::text::skip_handler </api/error handlers/skip_handler>`. You can use this function to perform encoding-aware and encoding-specific skips for a given encode and decode operation. This is particularly useful for Unicode encodings, as well as other variable-width encodings in the wild, which may be good to accommodate for in your own error handlers.
