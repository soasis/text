Skip Input on Error
===================

Some encodings know how to find the next valid sequence after they encounter an error. Many of these encodings are :doc:`self synchronizing codes </api/is_self_synchronizing_code>`, but yet still others may have enough information on their (encode/deocde) state to skip additional invalid input. This is where the function :doc:`ztd::text::skip_input_error </api/skip_input_error>` comes in, and the Lucky 7 Extension hook that allows an encoding to define the function. There are 2 versions of this function that are optional and can be written by an encoding author:

- ``decode_result<…> skip_input_error(decode_result<…> result)``, which is meant to skip over bad input from a failed decode operation;
- and, ``encode_result<…> skip_input_error(encode_result<…> result)``, which is meant to skip over bad input from a failed encode operation.

They can appear in a normal encoding like so:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/snippets/include/my_encoding.hpp
	:linenos:
	:start-after: // ============================================================================ //
	:emphasize-lines: 32-

The :doc:`ztd::text::decode_result </api/decode_result>` and :doc:`ztd::text::encode_result </api/encode_result>` contain all of the necessary information to perform the skip (``input``, ``output``, ``error_code``, ``state``, and ``error_count`` fields) that could be needed. For example, on a hypothetical UTF-16 encoding, one could define a ``skip_input_error`` function that behaves like so:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/snippets/include/my_utf16.hpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:start-after: // start my_utf16-snippet
	:emphasize-lines: 39-
	

Assuming, briefly, that this was all put into a file called ``my_utf16.hpp``, it can be used like this:

.. literalinclude:: /../../examples/documentation/snippets/source/design.skip_input_error.cpp
	:language: cpp
	:linenos:
	:start-after: // ============================================================================ //

This will come in handy when defining other Unicode variants that may need to skip multiple bits of bad input rather than juts passing over 1 code unit. :doc:`ztd::text::replacement_handler </api/error handlers/replacement_handler>` and :doc:`ztd::text::skip_handler </api/error handlers/skip_handler>` will both try to use these extension points to skip over bad input.
