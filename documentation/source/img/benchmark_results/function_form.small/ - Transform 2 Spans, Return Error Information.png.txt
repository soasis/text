Title: " - Transform 2 Spans, Return Error Information". Description: "Attempting to measure how the form of a function (pointers vs. sizes) changes affects repetitive use."

There are 8 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- err_ptrptr_ptr_ptrptr_ptr is 8th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion using output pointers for the data and its size and returning an error code.".
  Measures to a mean of "455.30685907267207" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- err_ptrptr_ptrsize_ptrptr_ptrsize is 7th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion using output pointers for the data and its size.".
  Measures to a mean of "451.8944246050315" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- structptr_ptr_ptr_ptr_ptr is 6th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/pointer pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a list of pointers representing the beginning and end of the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "451.1019044890488" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- structptr_ptr_size_ptr_size is 5th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/pointer pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a two pointer/size pairs representing the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "445.0513330288697" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- structsize_ptr_ptr_ptr_ptr is 4th. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/size pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a list of pointers representing the beginning and end of the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "425.7604129888933" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- structsize_ptr_size_ptr_size is 3rd. Described as: "An indivisible unit conversion returning a structure which contains the error code with a pointer/size pair representing input and output, and the function input takes a two pointer/size pairs representing the input and output spans.".
  Measures to a mean of "421.4638446103867" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "199.72693297916393" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.8699909560382366e-07" nanoseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
