Title: "C Character Set Conversion - Internals - UTF-8 to UTF-32 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-8 data to UTF-32 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 11 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- cuneicode_registry is 11th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "130.22490297607007" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk_unbounded is 10th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "120.55835541674848" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_single_from_bulk is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "119.12860166648032" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "119.10206880954017" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked is 7th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone (without checking for the validity of the input).".
  Measures to a mean of "118.34184177059798" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked_unbounded is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
  Measures to a mean of "115.34268416668662" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- standard_cpp is 5th. Described as: "Measures the deprecated std::codecvt_* functionality present in the C++ standard library.".
  Measures to a mean of "17.110313878569425" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- iconv is 4th. Described as: "Measures the libiconv (GNU version) encoding library, using its POSIX-compliant function call "iconv".".
  Measures to a mean of "0.4584350482167794" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- icu_ucnv_convertEx is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the ICU library and its conversion routines when routed through 2 generic "UConverter" converter objects.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.3924467343757074" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. Described as: "Measures just copying the correct, expected data to the desired output. This is useful as a reflection of how fast it could potentially be.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.004261044389167593" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.606669199342529e-13" microseconds, from 150 multi-iteration samples.
