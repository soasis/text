Title: "C Character Set - UTF-32 to UTF-16 (Well-Formed, with Init)". Description: "A conversion from UTF-32 data to UTF-16 data that contains no ill-formed or incomplete sequences."

There are 9 groups, and 2 data labels (cpu time, real time) per each group with data. Lower is better. 

- cuneicode_registry_unchecked is 9th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone (without checking for the validity of the input).".
  Measures to a mean of "34.77890522485892" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry is 8th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with all defaults left alone.".
  Measures to a mean of "33.88471371050776" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unchecked_unbounded is 7th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size, and without checking input validity).".
  Measures to a mean of "31.597631116008937" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- cuneicode_registry_unbounded is 6th. Described as: "Measures the ztd.cuneicode library from Shepherd's Oasis and its encoding routines, particularly the non-typed conversion routines from its Conversion Registry abstraction with specific conversion pathways overridden (without providing an output size).".
  Measures to a mean of "30.963448705317987" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- standard_cpp is 5th. Described as: "Measures the deprecated std::codecvt_* functionality present in the C++ standard library.".
  Measures to a mean of "23.54204081427951" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- icu_ucnv_convertEx is 4th. Described as: "Measures the ICU library and its conversion routines when routed through 2 generic "UConverter" converter objects.".
  Measures to a mean of "0.9459994790181607" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- iconv is 3rd. Described as: "Measures the libiconv (GNU version) encoding library, using its POSIX-compliant function call "iconv".".
  Measures to a mean of "0.6022128600001452" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- memcpy is 2nd. It has no description.
  Measures to a mean of "0.004293493140002829" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
- noop is 1st. Described as: "Measures doing literally nothing (no written expressions/statements in the benchmarking loop). Can be useful for determining potential environment noise.".
  Measures to a mean of "1.6199919627979398e-10" microseconds, from 100 multi-iteration samples.
